The Hel Mod adds some new stuff I suppose. It's mostly a remake of the more stuff mod I made a while back that is now outdated.

Sprites made by HelTalon and Stelthopuffa

Update 0.1.2.0

- Huge number of weapon & projectile re-works, re-balances and re-sprites
- Added over 60 new items
- Fixed certain projectile AIs & improved homing AIs
- Increased drop rates of the Hel Shard and Steltho Shard (from 1 / 200 to 1 / 25)
- Replaced the Broken Hero Bow with Hero Shards, dropped by all solar eclipse enemies
- Reworked debuffs for somewhat better functionality, and re-added Hel's Curse's ability to deal continous damage to enemies.
- Guns are now held in the correct positions
